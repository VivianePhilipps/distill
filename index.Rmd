# Profile

I am a statistican in the biostatistics team of the Bordeaux Population Health Center. I take part in the development of new statistical methods for analyzing longitudinal data. 
I mainly use mixed models, latent class models and joint shared random effects models within a maximum likelihood framework, and my applications focus on aging.

Most of my work is about :

- implementing the statistical methods developped in the team in user friendly R packages

- carrying out simulation studies to compare usual or/and innovative methods in biostatistics

- analyzing real data in aging, in terms of cognitive decline or dependency

- providing methodological support and programming assistance to the members of the team

- parallelization of algorithms

- programming in R, Fortran and C
